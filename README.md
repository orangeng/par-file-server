## Project Idea
- Our goal is to create our own file-sharing server (think like a Google Drive) where we can have client devices connect to the server to upload/retrieve files. This will consist of 2 programs - one for the server and one for the client.
- We will run our own minimal protocol for the communication between client-server instead of implementing popular protocols
- We wanted to do this as we were inspired by long-time protocols such as FTP and HTTP and started off with the idea of writing a client for these popular protocols. Furthermore, we aspire to set up our own home servers / NAS storages so it would be cool to have our own tool to do access / retrieval.
